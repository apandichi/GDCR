<p><strong>Noted Software Craftsman Corey Haines Uses Reverse Time-Travel to   Mark Global Day of Code Retreat in Sydney and Honolulu on  Dec. 3, 2011</strong></p>

<p><i>While software excellence events are conducted in 80+ cities across the globe.</i></p>

<p>(Chicago, Ill.) To create a world powered by better code, respected Software Journeyman Corey Haines introduces a one-day “Global Day of Code Retreat” (http://www.coderetreat.org) on Dec. 3, 2011, for software developers to practice their craft in cities around the world.</p>

<p>We entrust our lives and data to those who build software code, but in our fast-paced digital world, those craftsmen and women lack opportunities to practice coding with their peers. “So what,” you say?</p>

<p>“Our business and personal lives are powered by software. Well-crafted code hides in our pleasant daily existence. But when code fails, mayhem occurs: air-traffic-control systems go down, bank accounts get hacked, people lose money, the lights go out, communications go silent, commerce grinds to a halt,” said Haines.</p>

<p><strong>To further draw attention for the world’s need for skilled software craftspeople, Haines will become the first person to use reverse time travel to lead two code retreats in two global cities on just one day. Haines will start the day at the Sydney, Australia Code Retreat, hop on a 6pm flight to cross the International Dateline and arrive in time to lead the Day of Code Retreat in Honolulu, Hawaii, clocking a total of 27 hours from start to finish on one day.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Details</strong>Haines founded Global Day of Code Retreat 2011 to popularize the concept of practice in the development community. With the help of local organizers, more than 2,200 passionate craftspeople located in more than 80 cities will team up in coding a simple game – the Game of Life – six times each. Every time they’ll focus on a different aspect of writing quality code, sharing ideas and skills to learn from each other’s mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong>The event launches in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane on the morning of Dec. 3, 2011 and rolls west through six continents as coders “pass the torch” via Skype video calls to other groups around the world. (They’ll be tweeting about it using the Twitter hash tags <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/gdcr11">#gdcr11</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/coderetreat">#coderetreat</a>). The event wraps up in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>


<p><strong>Where:</strong> Global Day of Code Retreat takes place in more than 80 cities on six continents. For a complete map and schedule, please go to <a href="http://www.coderetreat.org/">http://www.coderetreat.org/</a></p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> The world needs agile software builders who can move quickly and effectively to meet the needs of businesses, organizations, governments and communities globally. Like concert pianists or athletes who practice the same exercises over and over again, software developers need practice to perform with perfection.</p>

<p>In addition to founding Global Day of Code Retreat, Haines has launched the coderetreat community contribution fund, a non-profit organization aimed at supporting local community-based eduction-oriented events, including teaching children at a young age how to code -- much like they are taught to play a musical instrument in their early lives.</p>
