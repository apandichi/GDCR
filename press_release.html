<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, NOVEMBER 19, 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Software Craftsmen/women Aim for Code Excellence On “Global Day of Code Retreat 2011”</strong></p>

<p>(Chicago, Ill.) To create a world powered by better code, respected Software Journeyman Corey Haines introduces a one-day “Global Day of Code Retreat” (http://www.coderetreat.org) on Dec. 3, 2011, for software developers to practice their craft in cities around the world.</p>

<p>We entrust our lives and data to those who build software code, but in our fast-paced digital world, those craftsmen and women lack opportunities to practice coding with their peers. “So what,” you say?</p>

<p>“Our business and personal lives are powered by software code. Well-crafted code hides in our pleasant daily existence. But when code fails, mayhem occurs: air-traffic-control systems go down, bank accounts get hacked, people lose money, the lights go out, communications go silent, commerce grinds to a halt,” said Haines.</p>

<p>Haines initiated Global Day of Code Retreat 2011 to help the growing software craftsmanship community improve their coding skills.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>With the help of local event organizers, more than 2,200 passionate software craftsmen/women located in 90 cities are registered to work in pairs, coding a simple game – the Game of Life – six times each. Every time they’ll focus on a different aspect of writing code well, working in pairs so they can share ideas, skills and learn from each other’s mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> On Dec. 3, 2011, they’ll come together around the world to hone their craft of software development.  Starting in Australia, and moving west through all the timezones, finally ending with an event in Honolulu, Hawaii 24 hours later, coders will “pass the torch” on to the next group in an Olympic-style “code run” across the globe (follow Global Day of Code Retreat on Twitter at #gdcr11 and #coderetreat).</p>

<p>Haines will become the first person to lead two code retreats in two global cities in one day. Haines will teach at the Sydney, Australia event, hop on a plane, fly over the International Dateline, effectively traveling back in time, and arrive in time to lead the Global Day of Code Retreat event in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> Global Day of Code Retreat takes place in more than 90 cities on six continents. For a complete map and schedule, please go to http://www.coderetreat.org/</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> The world needs agile software builders who can move quickly and effectively to meet the needs of businesses, organizations, governments and communities globally. Like concert pianists or athletes who practice the same exercises over and over again, software developers need practice to perform with perfection.</p>

<p>In addition to founding Global Day of Code Retreat, Haines has launched http://coderetreat.org, a non-profit organization aimed at supporting local community-based eduction-oriented events, including teaching children at a young age how to code -- much like they are taught to play a musical instrument in their early lives.</p>
