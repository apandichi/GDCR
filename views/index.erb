      Missed the Global Day of Coderetreat because there wasn't an event near you? Host your own!

      Coderetreats are run by volunteers who want to help out
      their local developer community.
      Hosts handle all of the logistics,
      and facilitators guide participants through the exercises.
      </p> <p>
      Coderetreats are easy to organize and facilitate.  Most of all, they are a lot of fun and a great way
      to meet other developers in your area!
